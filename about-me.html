    <p>I like coding, reading, thinking, eating, sleeping, and trying new things. I tried snowboarding two weeks ago for the first time: I was crazy bad at it, but I'm going to get better!</p>
    <p>My current work has me creating reports and managing user accounts in a web app designed for scheduling appointments. I know my way around an Excel sheet, and I like putting together functions in JS and Ruby and formulas in MS Excel and Google Docs.</p>
    <p>My goal is to get a job writing code. It's important to me that I receive feedback and direction so I can become a better developer.</p>
